This is a "stock picker" exercise from the Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/building-blocks): <br />
*Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.*
